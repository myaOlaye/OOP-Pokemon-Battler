# OOP Pokemon Battle Game

A small command-line game where users can catch and select Pok√©mon to battle.

I originally built this game to deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fundamentals. Initially, it was written in plain JavaScript, but I later rewrote it in TypeScript to improve my understanding of static typing and type safety.

This project helped me explore key programming concepts such as class-based design, inheritance, and encapsulation while reinforcing best practices in TypeScript.
